This love
	--Taylor Swift
Clear blue water
Hide tide came and brought you in
(And I could go on and on, on and on and on I will)
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
(And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone)
In Silence screams, in wildest dreams
I never dreams of this

This love is good
This love is bad
This love is alive
Back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me

Tossing turnning struggled throught the night with someone new
(And I could go on and on, on and on)
Lanters burning flickered in the mind only you
(But you were still gone gone gone)
In losing grip
On sinking ships
You showed up just in time

This love is good 
This love is bad
This love is alive
Back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me

Your kiss my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile my ghost
I fell to knees
When you're young you just run
But you come back
...To what you need

This love is good 
This love is bad 
This love is alive
Back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me

中文歌词
湛蓝海水
潮起潮落，待君归来
夜色渐浓，目送君走
无力挽留
无声呐喊，击碎心墙
未曾预料
爱像天堂
爱如炼狱
涅槃重生
被迫放手
袭上心头
辗转反侧，痴等君归
唯有前行，绝无后路
烛火摇曳，英姿重现
奈斯人已逝
夜不能寐，坠入深渊
正是那时，你又出现
爱是天堂
爱如炼狱
涅槃重生
被迫放手
永不磨灭
独自放光
被迫放手
犹在心里住
绵绵细吻轻落脸颊
目送君去
笑意冉冉未曾相忘
无助悲伤
风华正茂奔向远方
却又跑向你需要的地方
爱是天堂
爱如炼狱
涅槃重生
食指微动让爱自由
却袭上心头
永世铭记
爱既是光
看君离去未曾回头
伊人在梦中
